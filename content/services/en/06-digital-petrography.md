**Goal:** Quantitative Digital Petrography (QDP) for energy sector reservoir characterization and mineral liberation analysis.

We transition geology from qualitative description to quantitative data science. Our pipelines process gigapixel thin sections and pore networks, extracting measurable insights for reservoir modeling and resource optimization.

- Gigapixel Thin Section Processing
- Automated Mineralogy (SEM-EDS Analysis)
- Pore Network Modeling (PNM)
- Grain Size & Morphology Quantification

---

**Deliverable:** Statistical petrographic reports with spatial distribution maps and pore connectivity metrics.
