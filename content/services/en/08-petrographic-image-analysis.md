**Focus:** Characterizing pore networks and quantifying mineral composition and grain structures in rock thin sections.

We develop automated analysis workflows of geological samples, enhancing reservoir characterization, mineral exploration, and materials science research.

- Porosity & permeability analysis
- Mineral phase segmentation & quantification
- Grain size & shape distribution analysis
- Fracture network characterization
