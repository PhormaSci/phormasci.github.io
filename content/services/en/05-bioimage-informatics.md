**Goal:** Custom High-Content Analysis (HCA) pipelines and Spatial Transcriptomics consulting for pharma R&D and academic labs.

We act as a "Virtual Core Facility" automating the quantification of cellular phenotypes and tissue architecture. Our solutions transform manual microscopy workflows into production-grade computational pipelines.

- Automated HCS Pipelines (Nextflow/Snakemake)
- Deep Learning Segmentation (StarDist/U-Net)
- Spatial Transcriptomics Registration
- Batch Processing & Quality Control

**Deliverable:** Reproducible image analysis workflows with validation metrics and deployment documentation.
