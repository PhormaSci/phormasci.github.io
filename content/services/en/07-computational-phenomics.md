**Goal:** Precision agriculture analytics focusing on Root System Architecture (RSA) and multispectral UAV analysis for crop optimization.

We deploy quantitative algorithms for the "hidden half" of plants and process aerial imagery for stress mapping and yield prediction. Our solutions bridge the gap between field phenotyping and actionable agronomic insights.

- Root System Architecture (RSA) Topology
- UAV Multispectral & Thermal Analytics
- High-Throughput Phenotyping Pipelines
- Crop Stress Detection & Yield Modeling

**Deliverable:** Phenotypic trait databases with statistical models and spatial visualization dashboards.
