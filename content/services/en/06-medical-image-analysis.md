**Goal:** Multi-modal image analysis ranging from cellular quantification in histopathology to volumetric segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

We develop custom deep learning models and image analysis pipelines to extract critical information from medical images, supporting clinical research and diagnostic workflows.

- Automated tumor segmentation & grading
- Cell counting & classification
- Biomarker quantification in tissue samples
- Spatial analysis of cellular structures
