Master the fundamentals of treating images as numerical arrays and building reproducible analysis pipelines. Eliminate "point-and-click" workflows in favor of batch-processable, version-controlled code.

- NumPy array operations & image representation
- Scikit-image for filtering and segmentation
- Batch processing strategies & file I/O
- Pandas integration for quantitative results
- Quality control & validation metrics
