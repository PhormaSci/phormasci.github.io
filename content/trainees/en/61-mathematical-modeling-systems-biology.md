Learn how to translate biological questions into mathematical models. This course covers the fundamentals of building, simulating, and analyzing models of biological systems, from single cells to populations.

- Ordinary differential equation (ODE) based modeling
- Parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis
- Bifurcation analysis and multistability
- Stochastic modeling of biological processes
- Network analysis of biological pathways
