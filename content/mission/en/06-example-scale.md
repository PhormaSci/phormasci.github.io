**The Problem:** Hardcoded local file paths. Single-threaded loops processing gigabytes. Simulations that require a week to complete.

**Our Solution:** We migrate to cloud-native architectures (AWS/GCP) with parallel processing frameworks. Object storage replaces local paths. Distributed compute replaces for-loops.

**The Outcome:** Terabyte-scale datasets process in minutes. Week-long simulations complete in under 10 minutes. Compute scales elastically with demand.
