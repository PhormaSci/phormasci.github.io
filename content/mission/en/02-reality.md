Principal Investigators and academic founders often discover a critical gap too late: the code that published their groundbreaking paper is fundamentally unsuited for a commercial product.

**Academic Code** is optimized for a single successful execution. It demonstrates feasibility. It validates the "happy path." It earns citations.

**Production Code** is optimized for scale, security, and resilience. It handles edge cases. It processes terabytes. It passes Venture Capital technical due diligence.

The distinction is not obvious until it becomes expensive.
