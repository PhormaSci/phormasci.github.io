Without re-architecting, teams encounter critical failures at the worst possible moments:

- **During fundraising:** International VCs conduct rigorous technical due diligence. Code that "works on my machine" raises red flags about execution risk.
- **At scale:** Algorithms designed for small datasets hit the single-core bottleneck. Week-long simulations become month-long nightmares.
- **In production:** Hardcoded file paths, missing error handling, and lack of reproducibility create operational chaos.

These are not research failures. They are engineering failures—preventable with the right expertise.
