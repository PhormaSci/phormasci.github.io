**The Challenge:**

Scientific computations and data processing are often constrained by legacy infrastructure, leading to bottlenecks with large datasets or complex simulations. The ambition is to achieve rapid, elastic scalability to handle growing demands and accelerate discovery.

**Our Solution:**

We migrate to cloud-native architectures (AWS/GCP) with parallel processing frameworks. Distributed compute replaces for-loops.

**The Outcome:**

Terabyte-scale datasets process in minutes. Compute scales elastically with demand.
