**The Problem:**

Hardcoded local file paths. Single-threaded loops processing gigabytes. Simulations that require a week to complete.

**Our Solution:**

We migrate to cloud-native architectures (AWS/GCP) with parallel processing frameworks. Distributed compute replaces for-loops.

**The Outcome:**

Terabyte-scale datasets process in minutes. Compute scales elastically with demand.
