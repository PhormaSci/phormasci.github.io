**The Problem:**

A 5,000-line monolithic script. Great math, poor accessibility. No documentation, no tests, no version control.

**Our Solution:**

We decompose spaghetti code into modular, documented libraries. We wrap scientific logic in professional architecture. Every function has a single responsibility.

**The Outcome:**

The codebase becomes transferable, extendable, and audit-ready. The "knowledge" is finally usable.
