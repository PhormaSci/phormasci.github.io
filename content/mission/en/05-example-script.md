**The Challenge:**

A powerful scientific script, rich in mathematical innovation, has delivered groundbreaking research results. The next step is to evolve this core logic into a production-ready system that is scalable, maintainable, and accessible for broader application.

**Our Solution:**

We decompose spaghetti code into modular, documented libraries. We wrap scientific logic in professional architecture. Every function has a single responsibility.

**The Outcome:**

The codebase becomes transferable, extendable, and audit-ready. The "knowledge" is finally usable.
