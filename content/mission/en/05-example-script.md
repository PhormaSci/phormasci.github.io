**The Problem:**

A 5,000-line monolithic script that runs exclusively on one student's laptop. No documentation. No tests. No version control discipline.

**Our Solution:**

We decompose the spaghetti code into modular, documented libraries with automated unit tests. Every function has a single responsibility. Every module has a clear interface. Every commit passes CI/CD.

**The Outcome:**

The codebase becomes transferable, extendable, and audit-ready. New developers onboard in days, not months.
