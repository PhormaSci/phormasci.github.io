Ad-hoc scientific code is often slow, non-compliant, and unmaintainable.

Research teams build prototypes that work in Jupyter notebooks but fail under production constraints. Performance degrades. Numerical accuracy becomes questionable. Technical debt compounds.

The gap between research and deployment widens, and innovation stalls at the prototype stage.
