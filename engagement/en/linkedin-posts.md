### Post 1: The Main Announcement

**Type:** Announcing a new, free resource.

**Text:**

Does your R&D team spend more time fixing code than doing research? You're not alone. "Technical debt" in scientific software is one of the biggest brakes on innovation.

At Phorma Scientific, we've seen the brightest teams get slowed down by fragile internal tools, irreproducible analyses, and workflows that don't scale.

That's why we created the **Scientific Software Maturity Diagnosis**: a free, 5-minute survey designed to give you a clear view of your computational ecosystem's health.

Find out if your software is a strategic asset or an operational bottleneck.

### Post 2: The "Bus Factor" Pain Point

**Type:** Focusing on a specific pain point (key-person risk).

**Text:**

Your lab's "bus factor" is 1.

If your key computational scientist leaves tomorrow, does progress grind to a halt?

For many R&D organizations, critical knowledge isn't in documents; it's in one person's head. The code is on their laptop, the data is in a local folder, and the environment is nearly impossible to replicate.

This fragility is a massive risk to continuity and innovation.

Assessing your team's resilience is the first step to fixing it. We've designed a tool to help you measure this and other risks.

### Post 3: The Benefit (The Vision)

**Type:** Focusing on the desired outcome (speed and agility).

**Text:**

Imagine this: A scientist develops a new analysis script. It works. The next day, the entire team can use it safely and reliably, with no hand-holding from the author.

Sound like science fiction?

We've seen the "successful prototype" to "production tool" handoff take months, and it's where the most time and innovation are lost.

Going from a cycle of months to days isn't magic. It's engineering. It's culture. And it starts with an honest diagnosis of where you are today.

Want to accelerate your R&D cycle? The first step is understanding what's slowing you down.

### Post 4: The Direct Question (Quantification)

**Type:** Directly challenging leaders on the hidden cost.

**Text:**

Quick question for R&D leaders:

What percentage of your research budget is actually spent on... "research"?

If your team is investing 30%, 40%, or even 60%+ of their time maintaining old software, cleaning data, or fixing bugs... that's a massive opportunity cost.

That's time that could be spent discovering new drugs, developing new materials, or analyzing more data.

At Phorma Scientific, we help teams reinvest that time into what truly matters. The first step is to measure the problem.
