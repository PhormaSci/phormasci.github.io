## Template 3: Survey Completion - Acknowledgment & Preliminary Assessment

**Subject:** Your Scientific Software Health Check Results - Next Steps

**To:** [Contact Name]
**From:** [Your Name], [Your Title]

---

Dear [Contact Name],

Thank you for completing the Scientific Software Health Check for [Organization Name]. Our team has reviewed your responses, and I wanted to share some preliminary observations.

**What We Noticed:**

Based on your survey, your organization appears to face the following challenges:

1. **[Pain Point 1]:** [Brief description based on their answers]
   - *Impact:* [Estimated impact on velocity/quality/cost]

2. **[Pain Point 2]:** [Brief description]
   - *Impact:* [Estimated impact]

3. **[Pain Point 3]:** [Brief description]
   - *Impact:* [Estimated impact]

**Preliminary Assessment:**

Your current **Scientific Software Maturity Level** appears to be approximately **Level [1-5]**: [Level Name]

This suggests that your team may be spending an estimated **[X%]** of their time on maintenance and debugging rather than scientific discovery. For a team of [Y] researchers, this represents approximately **$[Z]** in annual productivity loss.

[If they selected "Yes" for Deep Dive in the survey:]
**You indicated interest in a Deep Dive Diagnostic interview. This is an excellent next step.**

During this 45-minute session, we will:
- Validate these preliminary findings
- Quantify the ROI of addressing these inefficiencies
- Identify quick wins and long-term strategic improvements
- Discuss whether Phorma is the right partner to help

Please select a time for our Deep Dive interview: [Calendly link]

[If they selected "Maybe" or "Not at this time":]
**Next Steps:**

I understand you may want to digest this information before committing to a deeper conversation. Here are a few options:

1. **Read our insights:** [Link to relevant case study or whitepaper]
2. **Schedule a brief call:** If you have questions about this assessment, I'm happy to jump on a quick 15-minute call to clarify
3. **Stay in touch:** I'll check back in [timeframe] to see if your priorities have shifted

**No pressure—we're here when you're ready.**
