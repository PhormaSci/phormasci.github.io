## Template 1: Invitation to Take the Survey

**Objective:** Cold or warm outreach to invite prospects to take the initial diagnosis.

**Subject:** Is your scientific software slowing down innovation at [Organization Name]?

**Body:**

Hi [Contact Name],

My name is [Your Name] from Phorma Scientific. We help R&D teams like yours accelerate their research cycles by turning software prototypes into robust, scalable assets.

We often see brilliant teams spending up to 60% of their time maintaining fragile code or struggling with reproducibility, instead of focusing on the science.

To help identify these bottlenecks, we've created a 5-minute **Scientific Software Maturity Diagnosis**. It's designed to give you a clear view of the biggest opportunities for improvement in your workflows.

Taking the survey is the first step to understanding how to turn technical debt into a strategic advantage.

Would you be willing to invest 5 minutes to assess your software's health?

**Subject:** Great connecting - Summary & next steps

**Body:**

Hi [Contact Name],

Thank you for your time and transparency in our conversation today. I truly enjoyed learning about the challenges and goals at [Organization Name].

As we discussed, the primary challenge that seems to be holding your team back is **[summarize the key pain in one sentence, e.g., "the difficulty in scaling data analyses from a single researcher to the entire team in a reproducible way"]**.

The impact of this is non-trivial, as it translates into **[mention a discussed consequence, e.g., "project delays and a high opportunity cost for your senior scientists"]**.

**How can we solve this?**

Our conversation today was the first step. The next, if you are interested, is a deeper engagement.

We propose the creation of a **Modernization Report and Strategic Roadmap**. This is a paid service where our team conducts a thorough analysis and delivers a detailed action plan to:
*   Assess the maturity of your current workflows.
*   Quantify the ROI of addressing the inefficiencies.
*   Design a future software architecture that is scalable and robust.
*   Provide a prioritized roadmap to get there.

Would you be interested in receiving a formal, no-obligation proposal for this service?

I am available to answer any questions you may have.
