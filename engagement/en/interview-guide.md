# Guide for Free Diagnostic Interview (30 Minutes)

**Main Objective:** Validate the customer's "pains" identified in the survey, dig into the most critical one, and determine if there is a good fit to propose a paid service (Strategic Roadmap).

**Mode:** Consultative conversation. The goal is to provide clarity to the client, not to sell.

---

### Preparation (5 minutes before the call)

1.  **Review survey responses:** Identify 1-2 "pains" that seem most intense.
    *   *e.g., The client marked "Rewrite from scratch" for the production handoff and ">60% of time" on support.*
2.  **Review the contact's LinkedIn profile:** Understand their role and background.
3.  **Have their organization's name and their role handy.**

### Interview Structure (30 Minutes)

#### 1. Welcome & Alignment (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Establish a collaborative tone and confirm the purpose of the call.

**Opening Script:**
"Hi [Contact Name], thanks for your time. My name is [Your Name] from Phorma Scientific."

"I reviewed the answers you provided in our Maturity Diagnosis, and they were very insightful. The goal for these 30 minutes is simple: I want to dig into one or two of the challenges you mentioned to give you an outside perspective. This is a working session, not a pitch. My aim is for you to leave with a clearer idea, whether we continue to collaborate or not. Does that sound good?"

**Context Questions:**
*   "To start, could you briefly tell me what your team's main objective is for this year?"

#### 2. Deep Dive on the Main Pain (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Go beyond the survey answer to understand the story and consequences of the problem.

**Transition Script:**
"Thanks for that context. In your survey, you mentioned something that stood out to me: [**Mention the most striking answer**]. For example: *'When a scientist's prototype is successful, the engineering team has to rewrite it almost completely, delaying everything for months'.*"

**Exploration Questions (use 2-3 of these):**
*   "Could you tell me a recent story where this happened? What did that process look like?"
*   "When that occurs, what's the real impact on the project? Are we talking about delays, frustration, unexpected costs?"
*   "From your perspective, what's the root cause of that problem?"
*   "If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about that process, what would it be?"
*   (If applicable) "You mentioned your team spends about [X%] of its time on support tasks. What does that look like day-to-day?"

**Active Listening:** Use phrases like "That sounds frustrating," "I understand," "Tell me more about that" to validate their feelings and encourage them to share more.

#### 3. Closing & Proposing the Next Step (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Summarize the problem, connect it to a high-level solution, and introduce the Strategic Roadmap as the logical (and paid) next step.

**Summary Script:**
"Thanks for sharing that, [Contact Name]. What I'm hearing is that the main bottleneck isn't a lack of scientific ideas, but the friction in getting those ideas into a robust, scalable tool. This cycle of 'fragile prototype -> costly rewrite' is consuming valuable time that could be spent on innovation."

"You've described the problem perfectly."

**Bridge-to-Solution Script:**
"Solving this at the root involves building a bridge between the science and the software engineering, with practices and architectures that allow prototypes to evolve rather than be thrown away."

**Proposal Script:**
"Our conversation today has been an excellent first diagnosis. To design a real solution, the next step is a deeper analysis."

"For that, we offer a service called a **Modernization Report and Strategic Roadmap**. In it, our team dives into your workflows and code to deliver a concrete action plan, complete with ROI analysis and prioritized recommendations."

"You don't need to decide now, but **would you be interested in me sending you a formal, no-obligation proposal for this service?** You can then review it with your team."

**Final Close:**
*   **If yes:** "Perfect. I'll send the proposal over by email within 24 hours. Thanks again for your time; this was a very productive conversation."
*   **If they hesitate or say no:** "I understand, no problem at all. I appreciate your time and transparency all the same. I hope our conversation was helpful in clarifying your challenges. If anything changes in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out."
